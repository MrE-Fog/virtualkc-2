    <h2 id="exploring-caos">Exploring CAOS</h2>

<p>This is a little tour through CAOS, the operating system of the KC85 computers 
(CAOS means Cassette-Aided-Operating-System).</p>

<p>First, boot into the latest official CAOS version 4.2 from 1989 (toggle the
debugging UI overlay by pressing the <strong>Tab</strong> key):</p>

<p><img src="images/booting_42.png" alt="Booting CAOS 4.2" /></p>

<p>After about two seconds (yep, those little 8-bitters booted really fast),
CAOS is displaying a list of available commands and is ready to accept input:</p>

<p><img src="images/caos42.png" alt="CAOS 4.2" /></p>

<p>You can move the cursor freely around the screen using the <strong>[Arrow-keys]</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>[Enter]</strong> tries to parse whatever is on the current line as a command.</p>

<p><strong>[Shift-Backspace]</strong> clears the screen.</p>

<p>The command <strong>MENU</strong> rebuilds the list of available commands.</p>

<p><img src="images/menu.png" alt="Menu" /></p>

<h3 id="color-and-window-management">Color and window management</h3>

<p>The <strong>COLOR</strong> command changes the foreground and background color, there
are 15 foreground colors and 8 background colors to choose from. Note that
all numbers are expected as hexadecimal. This is true for all CAOS commands:</p>

<p><img src="images/colors.png" alt="Colors" /></p>

<p>The <strong>WINDOW</strong> command defines a rectangular window and assigns it an id,
basically a very simple tmux-like terminal-session-manager. The WINDOW command 
takes 5 parameters that define the window rectangle and a window id:</p>

<pre><code>WINDOW y h x w id
</code></pre>

<p>Where ‘x’ and ‘y’ are the coordinates of the top-left corner, and ‘w’ and
‘h’ are the window width and height. The max width of a window is 28 hex, and
the max height is 20 hex. The ‘id’ is a number between
0 and 9. Once windows are defined, they can be activated with</p>

<pre><code>WINDOW id
</code></pre>

<p>The following commands split the screen in half into two windows with 
different background colors (if you screw up, simply Reset the KC85/4 
using the debugger menu).</p>

<pre><code>[first press Shift-Backspace to clear the screen]
[then press Enter to get a prompt]

%WINDOW 10 10 0 28 1
%COLOR 0 6
[Shift-Backspace plus Enter to clear the new window]
%WINDOW 0 10 0 28 2
%COLOR 0 4
[Shift-Backspace plus Enter to clear the second window]
</code></pre>

<p>There should be 2 independent windows now which can be toggled with
the commands <strong>WINDOW 1</strong> and <strong>WINDOW 2</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="images/windows.png" alt="Windows" /></p>

<h3 id="assigning-function-keys">Assigning function keys</h3>

<p>Typing <strong>WINDOW 1</strong> and <strong>WINDOW 2</strong> to switch between windows is tedious,
lets assign these commands to F1 and F2:</p>

<pre><code>%KEY 1
WINDOW 1[Enter][Shift-Escape]
%KEY 2
WINDOW 2[Enter][Shift-Escape]
</code></pre>

<p>It should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="images/key.png" alt="Key" /></p>

<p>Pressing <strong>F1</strong> and <strong>F2</strong> will now switch between the 2 windows.</p>

<p>The command <strong>KEYLIST</strong> shows all current function key assignments:</p>

<p><img src="images/keylist.png" alt="Keylist" /></p>

<p>Switch back to the original window by typing <strong>WINDOW</strong> without any
arguments, then type <strong>MENU</strong> to get the list of commands.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-and-editing-memory-contents">Viewing and editing memory contents</h3>

<p>The command <strong>DISPLAY</strong> shows a hex-dump of the memory starting 
at <strong>aaaa</strong> with <strong>ss</strong> number of lines at a time and <strong>n</strong> columns:</p>

<pre><code>DISPLAY aaaa [ss [n]]
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, to show the start of the pixel video memory:</p>

<pre><code>%DISPLAY 8000 4
...
[Escape]
</code></pre>

<p><img src="images/display.png" alt="Display" /></p>

<p>The DISPLAY command will wait for keyboard input. Hit [Escape] to 
go back to the command prompt.</p>

<p>The <strong>MODIFY</strong> command implements a simple hex-editor. Let’s mess up some video
memory starting at address 8000: Type <strong>MODIFY 8000</strong>, and enter some
hex-numbers, then press [Enter]. Enter a <strong>dot</strong> to go back to the command
prompt:</p>

<p><img src="images/modify.png" alt="Modify" /></p>

<h3 id="memory-banks-expansion-slots-and-modules">Memory banks, expansion slots and modules</h3>

<p>The commands <strong>SYSTEM</strong>, <strong>MODUL</strong>, <strong>JUMP</strong> and <strong>SWITCH</strong> control the
hardware expansion system. Each KC85 has 2 expansion slots numbered <strong>08</strong> and 
<strong>0C</strong>. Additional ‘bus-driver’ devices with 4 more expansion slots could
be stacked on top of the base device.</p>

<p>The command <strong>SYSTEM</strong> gives an overview of the built-in memory banks:</p>

<p><img src="images/system.png" alt="System" /></p>

<p>This means:</p>

<pre><code>CAOSE ON:   the operating system ROM at address E000 is switched on
ROMC 0 OFF: both ROM banks at address C000 are switched off
RAM0 ON:    the built-in RAM at address 0000 is switched on
RAM4 ON:    the built-in RAM at address 4000 is switched on
RAM8 0 ON:  the first of the 2 RAM banks at address 8000 is switched on
BILD 0:     the first video memory area (out of 2) is displayed
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>SWITCH</strong> command is used to control built-in memory banks and
expansion modules:</p>

<pre><code>SWITCH mm kk
</code></pre>

<p><strong>mm</strong> is the module slot or memory bank id, and <strong>kk</strong> is a control byte.</p>

<p>The following ids are used for the built-in memory banks and the
expansion slots of the base device:</p>

<pre><code>RAM at address 0000:      mm = 00
video memory:             mm = 01
ROM banks:                mm = 02
RAM at address 8000:      mm = 03
RAM at address 4000:      mm = 04
right expansion slot:     mm = 08
left expansion slot:      mm = 0C
</code></pre>

<p><strong>kk</strong> encodes the on/off state (bit 0), write protection (bit 1) and starting
address (bits 4..7).</p>

<p>For instance to switch off the memory bank at address 4000:</p>

<pre><code>%SWITCH 04 00
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>SYSTEM</strong> command, and <strong>DISPLAY</strong>ing the memory at address 4000 confirm
that the memory is no longer mapped:</p>

<p><img src="images/switch.png" alt="Switch" /></p>

<p>Switch it back on with:</p>

<pre><code>%SWITCH 04 43
</code></pre>

<p>The SWITCH command is also used to control modules in expansion slots.</p>

<p>Insert the FORTH expansion module into slot 08 using the debugging UI 
(on a real KC85, you must only do this when the device is powered down!):</p>

<p><img src="images/expansion.png" alt="Expansion" /></p>

<p><img src="images/forth_module.png" alt="Forth Module" /></p>

<p>The FORTH module is now in expansion slot 08, as can be seen with the <strong>MODUL</strong>
command, but it is not switched-on yet. To function properly, the 
module must be switched to address C000, this is achieved with the
command <strong>SWITCH 08 C1</strong> (08 means ‘expansion slot 08’, the ‘C’ in C1 means 
‘at address C000, and the ‘1’ in C1 means: ‘active’). Another MODUL
command confirms that the modul in slot 08 has the new control byte C1
(the <strong>FB</strong> is the module hardware identifier):</p>

<p><img src="images/switch_forth.png" alt="Forth Activate" /></p>

<p>When displaying the <strong>MENU</strong> again, there are now 2 new commands called
<strong>FORTH</strong> and <strong>REFORTH</strong> (at least when you’re on the KC85/4):</p>

<p><img src="images/forth_menu.png" alt="Forth Menu" /></p>

<p>If you’re <em>not</em> seeing the two new menu entries, you’re on a KC85/3, where
the BASIC ROM is blocking access to the FORTH module. In this case,
the BASIC ROM must be switched off first with <strong>SWITCH 02 00</strong>.</p>

<p>To give it a try, type <strong>FORTH</strong>, when done, return to the CAOS command
prompt with <strong>BYE</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="images/forth_demo.png" alt="Forth Demo" /></p>

<p>The remaining module management command <strong>JUMP</strong> is used to jump into
an alternative operating system provided in a ROM module. In the emulator, 
this is currently only useful with the M006 BASIC ROM module for the KC85/2.
How this works is left as an excersice to the reader ;)</p>

<h3 id="cassette-loadingsaving-and-v24-control">Cassette loading/saving, and V24 control</h3>

<p>Before you get excited, all the remaining commands don’t do anything
useful in the emulator.</p>

<p>On a real KC85, the commands <strong>LOAD</strong>, <strong>SAVE</strong> and <strong>VERIFY</strong> are used
to load and save data from and to cassettes, and verify a saved file.</p>

<p>In the emulator, LOAD and VERIFY will simply wait forever. For shitz’n’giggles 
you can try to save some data (make sure you have sound enabled):</p>

<p><img src="images/save.png" alt="Saving" /></p>

<p>It sounds cool, but the sound emulation isn’t precise enough that the
save audio signal would be any useful.</p>

<p>The 2 remaining commands, <strong>V24OUT</strong> and <strong>V24DUP</strong> were used to control
the V24-interface module. V.24 was (is?) a serial interface standard used 
to communicate between machines, modems and printers.</p>
